/**
 * @brief This function can be used to perform an offset calibration. Offset
 * corresponds to the difference in millimeters between real distance and
 * measured distance. ST recommend to perform offset at 100m, on a grey17%
 * reflective target, but any other distance and reflectance can be used.
 * The function returns the offset value found and programs the offset
 * compensation into the device.
 * @param (Dev_t) dev : instance of selected VL53L4ED sensor.
 * @param (int16_t) TargetDistInMm : Real distance between the sensor and the
 * target in millimeters. ST recommend 100mm. Min distance is 10mm and max is
 * 1000mm.
 * @param (int16_t) nb_samples : Number of samples (between 5 and 255). A higher
 * number of samples increases the accuracy, but it also takes more time. ST
 * recommend to use at least 10 samples.
 * @return (VL53L4ED_ERROR) status : 0 if OK, or 255 if something occurred (e.g
 * invalid nb of samples).

/**
 * @brief This function can be used to perform a Xtalk calibration. Xtalk
 * represents the correction to apply to the sensor when a protective coverglass
 * is placed at the top of the sensor. The distance for calibration depends of
 * the coverglass, it needs to be characterized. Please refer to the User Manual
 * for more information.
 * The function returns the Xtalk value found and programs the Xtalk
 * compensation into the device.
